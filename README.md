=====================
This is going to be my personal website, and it will host some code I've made and/or forked.

My name is Sergio Agudelo, I was born and am currently living in Bogot√°, Colombia; and I'm a Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
I'm working on Digital systems and microcontrollers (using Verilog/VHDL for the former, and C/Arduino and probably Assembly for the latter) but I'm learning web development as well.
