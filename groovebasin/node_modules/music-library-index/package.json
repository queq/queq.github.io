  "readme": "# Music Library Index\n\nGiven track metadata objects, constructs a searchable object model.\nThis module is used both in the client and the server of\n[Groove Basin](https://github.com/superjoe30/groovebasin).\n\n## Features\n\n * Sort order ignores 'a', 'an' and 'the' in artists, albums, and names.\n * Sorting and searching is case insensitive and\n   [diacritics-insensitive](https://github.com/superjoe30/diacritics).\n * Searching uses word-based filtering (this is how most music player\n   applications implement filtering) on all track fields.\n * Distinguishes albums by name, date, and album artist.\n * Produces these indexes:\n   * Artists in sorted order\n     - For each of these artists, albums in sorted order.\n       - For each of these albums, tracks in sorted order.\n   * Albums in sorted order\n     - For each of these albums, tracks in sorted order.\n   * Tracks by user-defined key.\n   * Artists by library-defined key.\n   * Albums by library-defined key.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar MusicLibraryIndex = require('music-library-index');\nvar library = new MusicLibraryIndex();\n\nlibrary.addTrack({\n  key: \"Anberlin/Never Take Friendship Personal/02. Paperthin Hymn.mp3\",\n  name: \"Paperthin Hymn\",\n  artistName: \"Anberlin\",\n  albumName: \"Never Take Friendship Personal\",\n  year: 2005,\n  genre: \"Other\",\n  track: 2,\n  albumArtistName: \"Anberlin\",\n});\n\nlibrary.addTrack({\n  key: \"Anberlin/Never Take Friendship Personal/08. The Feel Good Drag.mp3\",\n  name: \"The Feel Good Drag\",\n  artistName: \"Anberlin\",\n  albumName: \"Never Take Friendship Personal\",\n  year: 2005,\n  genre: \"Other\",\n  track: 8,\n  albumArtistName: \"Anberlin\",\n});\n\nlibrary.rebuild();\n\nconsole.log(library.artistList[0]);\nconsole.log(library.trackTable);\n```\n\n## Tests\n\n```\n  basic index building\n    ✓ trackTable \n    ✓ artistList \n    ✓ albumList \n    ✓ searching \n\n  compilation album\n    ✓ filed in various artists \n\n  tracks from same album missing year metadata\n    ✓ still knows they're in the same album \n\n  different albums with same name\n    ✓ detects that they are different \n\n  album with a few tracks by different artists\n    ✓ only creates one album \n```\n",
